# PCA Implementation and Comparison with sklearn

In this notebook, I explore Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the Olivetti Faces dataset, which is available through the `sklearn` library.

In the first part, I apply PCA using the official `sklearn` implementation to compress one of the images in the dataset into a subspace defined by eigenvectors that explain 90% of the variance. The result is visualized for comparison. The code for this section is taken directly from the official `sklearn` website and is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License. The full license text, including the copyright notice and disclaimer, is included in the source code provided.

In the second part, I implement a basic, custom version of PCA and apply it to compress the same image into a subspace defined by the eigenvectors that explain 90% of the variance. I then compare the results of this custom (naive) implementation with those obtained using the `sklearn` PCA algorithm.
