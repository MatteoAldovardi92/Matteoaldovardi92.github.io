# Purpose of This Site

Hello! I'm Matteo Aldovardi, a dedicated machine learning enthusiast and mathematician. This site serves as my personal blog and portfolio, where I document my exploration of data science, AI, and mathematics, sharing insights, projects, and my learning journey along the way. I also tutor students from high school to university in mathematics, so I've added a Tutoring section to share resources and interactive lessons. Check out my [portfolio](portfolio.qmd) for projects and examples of my work, or visit my [blog](blog/index.qmd) for insights and updates on my latest explorations.
