Here are some of the key projects and publications Iâ€™ve worked on:

- **Internship with Leonardo in 3D Deep Learning:** 

As part of the Master's in Mathematical and Physical Models for Engineering, I completed a curricular internship at Leonardo Divisione Velivoli in Turin. During this time, I focused on reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images, combining computer vision techniques with 3D deep learning frameworks. This hands-on experience allowed me to explore how machine learning can address the limitations of traditional photogrammetry, applying my mathematical expertise to develop innovative solutions in aerospace applications.

- **Publication**: [A Note on Hardy's Inequality for Pseudo-Differential Operators](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40574-023-00359-7)  
  This publication explores applications of Hardy's inequality within the realm of pseudo-differential operators, contributing insights into mathematical analysis and operator theory.
